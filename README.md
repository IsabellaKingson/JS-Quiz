# JS-Quiz

## Description

I created this quiz to review javascript fundamentals. It is a great resource for those learning javaScript for the first time to review what they have learned and track their progress through score improvements. While I was making a quiz about javascript fundamentals, I was learning how to use jQuery to streamline vanilla JS. I learned about interaction with the window location and local storage.

I also had a lot of help from my tutor Alistair Rowden with navigating jQuery, adding event listeners, and debugging.
